					<dt>Trouble in Thornwood</dt>
					<dd>
						<p><b>Objective: </b>
							Determine what destroyed the city of Alderwood and the surrounding region.
						</p>
						<p><b>Reward: </b>
							Emeric will be freed from his card prison.
						</p>
						<p><b>Received from: </b>
							Ajerban the 2nd
						</p>
						<p><b>Details: </b></p>
						<p>
							The original owner of the Deck of Many Things met with the party in their loft above Temp Consulting. He requested that the card be returned to him, but didn’t want to release Emeric from the card without fair compensation. However, he wasn’t interested in gold. Rather, he asked the party to travel to Thornwood and investigate the cause of a recent disaster: the destruction of the elven city of Alderwood.
						</p>
						<p><b>Updates: </b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The party journeyed to the Temple of Corellon, where they met an elf named Shen. Shen claimed to have lost control of a spell, releasing an inferno upon Alderwood that he compared to the sun. Shen also claimed to have been blinded by the inferno, and that he now lived in isolation at the temple as penance.
								</li>
								<li>
									Shen claimed not to perform any more magic, then immediately conjured Emeric (and 50,000gp worth of jewelry) from his card prison. Rightfully, this elicited suspicion from the party.
								</li>
								<li>
									Rooze tracked the party to ensure their well-being, as Toranaga arrived in Hlondeth recently and placed a bounty on the party’s heads. Rooze’s purpose was to ensure that he would receive his rightful share of the jewelry, but has continued with the party due to the dangers of traveling alone in the wild.
								</li>
								<li>
									A dragonborn named Surina fled to the temple after being attacked by a tiefling hunting party. It was surmised that the group that attacked him may have been seeking the party for Toranaga’s bounty.
								</li>
								<li>
									The party opted to travel south along the river to Ankhapur.
								</li>

					<dt>Destroy the Goblinrock</dt>
					<dd>
						<p><b>Objective: </b>
							Destroy the hive of goblins near the southwest bank of Vilhon Reach.
						</p>
						<p><b>Reward: </b>
							25gp per adventurer, paid in advance.
						</p>
						<p><b>Received from: </b>
							Temp Consulting
						</p>
						<p><b>Details: </b></p>
						<p>
							Goblins are a common problem in Faerun. They build lairs or squat in ruins, then proceed to harass locals and travelers. Despite their small stature, they can be very dangerous. Temp likened them to a hive of stinging hornets. The people of Ormpetarr recently reported a goblin lair, dubbed the Goblinrock, on the shores south of Hlondeth. Ridding the area of goblins would require an adventuring party to cross the sea and destroy it. To ensure they wouldn’t rebuild their lair elsewhere, the party was also tasked with slaying every last wretch that resided there.
						</p>
						<p><b>Updates: </b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The party crossed Vilhon Reach and slew a goblin hunting party as they traversed the sandy wastes between the sea and jungle.
								</li>
								<li>
									With some effort, the party was able to find the goblin lair and kill its inhabitants.
								</li>
							</ul>

					<dt>Deadbeat Wizard</dt>
					<dd>
						<p><b>Objective: </b>
							Go to the windmill where Ajerban the wizard lives and retrieve a magical artifact from him.
						</p>
						<p><b>Reward: </b>
							25gp per adventurer, paid in advance.
						</p>
						<p><b>Received from: </b>
							Rurik, through Temp Consulting
						</p>
						<p><b>Details: </b></p>
						<p>
							Presumably, Ajerban was a wizard who’d retrieved a valuable artifact for a dubious group known as the Dead Men. He was expected to deliver it to a member of the Dead Men, Rurik, but had not. No one had seen or heard from him in some time, but due to his powerful magical capabilities, the Dead Men did not want to be directly involved if conflict broke out. For that reason, they hired expendable sellswords to investigate and retrieve the artifact for them. 
						</p>
						<p><b>Updates: </b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The party found Ajerban deceased inside his home. His body was later turned in to the town guard for a proper burial.
								</li>
								<li>
									The artifact was kept in a small, wooden box. It was guarded by simple magical traps, but the party was able to escape with the box before the traps could cause any serious harm.
								</li>
								<li>
									Emeric peered into the box and found a deck with 22 cards. The deck was able to communicate with Emeric as though it were a voice in his head. It asked him how many cards he wished to draw and, not realizing the dark and mysterious power it held, he responded: six.
								</li>
								<li>
									At that moment, six cards flew from the deck and a flurry of magic overtook Emeric. He gained great power, but was entrapped within one of the cards along with 50,000gp worth of fine jewelry. Somehow, an acquaintance of his became hostile and resentful towards him, though he had no idea who. Further, at that moment a fiend learned his name and came to hate him. It would become that fiend’s sole pursuit: to find and inflict misery on Emeric.
								</li>
								<li>
									The party was scolded and threatened by Rurik learned what had transpired, and they returned the deck to him sans Emeric’s card.
								</li>
