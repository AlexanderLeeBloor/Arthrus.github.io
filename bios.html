					<dt>Cecil</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A young bard drifting from place to place as he seeks out a mysterious drow named Carlos. Little is known of Cecil's intentions. Perhaps he's developed an infatuation?</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Elara Silveraxe</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Elara Silveraxe: paladin of Cangleddin Silverbeard. Taken captive aboard Toranaga's slave ship, she was separated from her holy silver axe and unable to retrieve it during her escape. The axe is a defining symbol of her order and all that Silverbeard stands for. Now the pirates have it, and it is up to her to reclaim it!
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Emeric</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						A lophius monk, Emeric is a capable locksmith and armorsmith.
						</p>
						<p>
						After escaping from Toranaga's slave ship, Emeric took on a simple job to acquire money for food and lodging in Hlondeth. He'd been hired to retrieve a magical deck of cards, which tempted him to draw from it. Upon doing so, he was raptured away into one of the cards, magically empowered, showered in wealth, alienated from a past associate, and secured the emnity of a powerful fiend.
						</p>
						<p>
						Emeric spent one month imprisoned in the card before his friends were offered an opportunity to set him free, in exchange for a favour to a powerful magician (the original owner of the stolen deck of cards). The party was tasked with determining the cause of a catastrophic fire that burnt down the elven city of Alderwood. When they arrived on the outskirts of the forest, northeast of Alderwood, they encountered an isolated ascetic who had the magical capability to release Emeric from his prison. He claimed to be responsible for the fire that claimed Alderwood and was living in isolation to atone. Before the party continued on their way, the monk taught Emeric an elven secret for crafting powerful, lightweight armor from the fallen leaves of plaguechanged trees.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Selka</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						An old grandmotherly figure, Selka was once a sailor. She eventually retired and started an adventuring business, but Temp's competition eventually put her out of work. She found herself taking on contract work through Temp Consulting to make ends meet, and found religion somewhere along the way. Most recently, she took on a quest to help rid Vilhon Reach's southern shore from a goblin lair. Due to complications thereafter, she's continued adventuring with the party.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Surina</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Surina is a dragonborn from Cormyr, though his upbringing was far from typical. Raised by a tribe of dragon-worshipping nomads, his family was brutish and combatative. He was often harrassed for his feminine name and burned as punishment for the smallest of slights. He fled south and began living as a ranger in exile.
						</p>
						<p>
						While camping in Thornwood, Surina found himself overrun by a band of tiefling mercenaries. His expertise in the forest enabled him to escape, but not without serious injury. He sought out the temple of Corellon for sanctuary and there he met up with the party. He warned them of the mercenaries and agreed that they ought to travel as a company for the safety of numbers.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Ulrig</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Goliaths are among the rarest of civilized races in Faerun. Known for their size and strenth, they make for great wrestlers. So thought Ulrig's parents when they concocted a scheme to kidnap a baby goliath and raise him as their own. He would be a prize fighter in their wrestling shows.
						</p>
						<p>
						And so he was for many years! But his supremacy in the ring wasn't enough for his parents. Their greed led them to raise the stakes and Ulrig found himself in a real life-or-death situation. His opponent had make an evil pact and was granted supernatural abilities, but even so Ulrig was victorious. He killed the man and found himself oddly affected by the event - something about him changed in a way he couldn't quite articulate, though he became known as Ulrig the Marked. Later, when defending the killing of his opponent, Ulrig broke kayfabe. For that, he was ostracized and he left town.
						</p>
						<p>
						Not long after, he was captured on Toranaga's slave ship. He saw parallels between slavery and the life he'd lived under his parents, and he began to hate it more than anything else. Fortunately, he was not a slave for long. He escaped from the vessel after it struck a shoal and wound up in the city of Hlondeth with a group of other escapees.
						</p>
						<p>
						While in Hlondeth, Ulrig became a well-recognized friend of the lowest caste: the kobolds. This was largely due to the token of goodwill he extended to a kobold named Sharptooth, who'd escaped with him from the ship. The kobolds honoured him with a glass pendant, whose necklace was crafted from his slave shackles. During his month in Hlondeth, Ulrig learned a few tidbits of draconic to communicate with Sharptooth.
						</p>
						<p>
						Emeric, one of Ulrig's companions, was entrapped in a magical card shortly after arriving in Hlondeth. Ulrig carried the card for a month before meeting a magician who would free his friend in exchange for a favour. He would go with his party to Thornwood and determine what event caused the destruction of the city of Alderwood. After some time in the forest, Ulrig noticed a strange mark on his chest. It looked like a battle scar or a faint tattoo, but exerted a light blue aura at times. He noticed similar markings on a fellow traveler named Odorf, but it is not clear how they came to be or if they hold a particular significance...

				<h3 class="quest_header">NPCs</h3>
				<dl class="accordion_2">
					<dt>Ajerban</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Little is known of Ajerban. The late wizard allegedly stole the Deck of Many Things (a powerful magical artifact) from another wizard, but died before he could ferry it to a buyer on the black market. Though his cause of death remains uncertain, it is likely he died of old age.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Ajerban the 2nd</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						A younger man than the 1st, Ajerban the 2nd was unwilling to share his true name. His very appearance suggested a great deal of mystery and guarded wisdom. He was a tall, slim man with wrinkles about his brow and his eyes. He had chestnut brown hair, medium length and well-groomed, with a van dyke beard. He was, perhaps, in his mid-forties. A tattered brown traveler’s cloak hung over his back, patched all over. On every patch was a rune, inscribed in a language unknown to the party.
						</p>
						<p>
						Ajerban the 2nd claimed ownership of the Deck of Many Things, but was not perturbed by the fact that Emeric had been trapped inside. Old memories seemed to flash before him, hidden behind his eyes. He offered to free Emeric in exchange for a favour – a perilous quest that would build character and teach the party about the world. In his speech, he implied a sense of tradition echoing a similar experience he’d had long ago. Too little is known about Ajerban the 2nd for anyone to say whether he is good, evil, or just plain crazy. 
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Carlos</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						A mysterious figure sought by Cecil. He is known to be a drow and to be investigating phenomena of some sort in the Vilhon Wilds. Rumoured to be absolutely dashing, and distinguishable by his immaculate black hair. It is long by the standards of human males, but short for a drow such as himself. Streaks of silvery-gray stem from his temples, lending the elegance of age to his otherwise youthful appearance. His hair smells of lavender.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Emmett</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						The son of a fishing captain, Emmett was a capable young man with an earnest curiosity about the world. Though he was strong and a skilled sailor, he wasn’t much to look at. He’d been in one too many fights and lost several teeth. His nose was crooked, and one eye seemed to open slightly wider than the other. He met the party in Hlondeth and was present on his father’s boat as the party chartered it to ferry them across Vilhon Reach. Due to the rocky shores of the Vilhon Wilds, Emmett was called upon to take the party the remaining miles in a rowboat.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Florestine</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Who is Florestine? Nothing is known about them. The party discovered a deed to their estate while looting the Goblinrock.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Nameless Stranger</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						While stopping by Ankhapur to inquire about Carlos, Cecil and Surina encountered a suspicious creature with no name at the local tavern. It was telepathic, and hid most of its visage behind a cloak that rose up nearly to its eyes. A small hole in the cloak allowed a long, straw-like appendage to uncoil and sip from a glass of water. The creature's skin was purple-grey and shone as though coated in a thin sheen of water. Its eyes were a soft shade of purple as well, like amethyst. From across the room, Emeric suspected it might be an illithid (a.k.a. a mind flayer), though Surina disagreed.
						</p>
						<p>
						The nameless stranger told Cecil and Surina that they were unlikely allies, and that it had come to Ankhapur to keep an eye on the strange events in the area. Aboleths, it said, had risen from their ancient slumber to reclaim the world. The creature had not seen any drow in the city, to Cecil's disappointment, though it did mark an entrance to the Underdark on the map in case it might be of use. The stranger requested that the party warn the lords and sovereigns of their homelands about the iminent threat of aboleths, so that they might raise a unified army to defend themselves. However, the party had little interest in such grand matters and bid the nameless creature a polite farewell. 
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Odorf</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Odorf is a halfling with an unconventional philosophy: that people can be divided into tall or short, and strong or lucky. Along with his peculiar ideas, he had a peculiar mark. Only Ulrig noticed it: a spellscar. It glowed faintly with a light blue tint. He met the party while fishing along the Thornwash, a southward-flowing river that leads to the city of Ankhapur.
						</p>
						<p>
						Odorf was enamoured by Elara. He saw that she, like him, was short. Though she relied on her strength, he believed she could be persuaded to renounce her ways and become lucky like him. He was unapologetically manipulative. To sway her, he told lies plain as day. He even cast spells to augment the lies. After being left behind, he followed alongside the party’s boat from the shore. The party reluctantly allowed him to journey downstream with them. One evening, the party decided to collect food for the next few days. While they hunted and fought with big game, Odorf used his smallness to avoid the beasts and sneak around to their nest. He collected their eggs, which he hoped to hatch and raise as his own with Elara. She was charmed by his efforts, but still unconvinced. Defeated, but not disheartened, Odorf left the party to continue his happy-go-lucky way of life.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Rooze</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Few drow choose willingly to live on the surface. Rooze paid for travel to Westgate on a ship called The Duchess. He claimed that there he would attend his father’s funeral, but in truth he’d been disowned and exiled from the Underdark. And why? For disrespecting his grandfather, the patriarch of his community. He was initially given a (false) choice between exile and a duel of honour. Despite choosing exile, Rooze knew that his seven brothers would hunt him down and kill him. They were unsuccessful.
						</p>
						<p>
						Rooze was cunning. He had an eye for detail and a resourcefulness that made him handy in a pinch. He wasn’t as tall as your average drow, but what he lacked in stature he more than made up for in guile. He outwitted his brethren and found his way to the surface. There, he made a living as a charlatan. He found humans amusing, but often vexing. To make the most of his talents, he eventually sought the larger cities of the surface world. He paid for passage across the Sea of Fallen Stars, but the ship he hired, The Duchess, turned out to be a slave ship. This was a blessing in disguise, because once Rooze slipped through Toranaga’s fingers, he found himself in Hlondeth. Few cities would afford him such opportunities as here.
						</p>
						<p>
						After escaping to Hlondeth, he soon left the other recently-escaped slaves in pursuit of lucrative criminal activities. He had a great deal of skill with blades, but avoided unnecessary fighting wherever possible. Indeed, the allure of organized crime is in its sophistication. Shortly after the party left Hlondeth, Rooze learned of a bounty placed by Toranaga on the heads of himself, Emeric, Ulrig, and Elara. Since Emeric was entrapped with a hoard of treasure, to which Rooze was entitled a share, he set out to track the party down and has rejoined them. He’s now received his share, but continues to journey with the party for the safety of traveling in numbers.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Rurik</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						A member of the Dead Men. Although not all Dead Men engage in criminal activity, Rurik is a fence for the organization, finding buyers for stolen property. Shrouded by a thin, black cloak, he first met the party while looking for expendable employees at Temp Consulting.
						</p>
						<p>
						Though he maintains his professionalism as he goes about his dealings, Rurik is very excitable. His temper shot up to a flashpoint when he learned that Emeric had meddled with the Deck of Many Things. When threatened by Ajerban the 2nd, he cowered and caved to the wizard’s demands without contest. When the party last saw him, he was distinctly uneasy. The buyer he’d arranged for the Deck of Many Things would be displeased to learn their transaction was cancelled, and there could very well be consequences for all involved...
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Sharptooth</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Sharptooth is a kobold. His reptilian race is vilified in Hlondeth. They are the lowest caste and have been so since a failed invasion hundreds of years in the past. It was a cruel twist of fate that Sharptooth escaped from Toranaga’s slave ship, The Duchess, only to find himself an outcast in his newfound sanctuary.
						</p>
						<p>
						Though most kobolds have two sharp fangs protruding from their upper jaw, Sharptooth has only one. He broke the other on the hull of The Duchess and used the shard to pick the locks of his shackles. After arriving in the city, Ulrig offered him a shark tooth as a token of respect. In return, Sharptooth and several other kobolds had a dragon’s eye (a glass pendant) forged from Ulrig’s chains.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Shen</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Shen is a wood elf and is better known as the lonesome cleric of Thornwood. He goes by his priestly name, Elohim the Deliverer. He wears heavy robes, covering his body from the neck down. His head is shaven and covered with tattoos, which seem to extend down his neck out of sight. A cloth bearing the silver sickle of Corellon is at all times wrapped about his eyes like a blindfold. He values knowledge, duty, and self-sufficiency.
						</p>
						<p>
						Shen claims to have caused the calamity that destroyed Alderwood. He was once a powerful sorcerer and an acolyte of the Order of Blue Fire. Five years ago, while practicing a spell of conflagration, Shen lost control of his spell. It surged with an energy like nothing he’d ever known. It eradicated Alderwood, like a sun descendant upon Toril. So bright was the inferno that Shen was blinded instantly.
						</p>
						<p>
						Now, in penance for his negligence, Shen lives in service to Corellon, god of elves. He seeks to master his ki, so that he me live eternally in service. As penance, he intends to live one lifetime in service to Corellon for every elf that died on that day five years ago. For the safety of others, he no longer casts spells and he chooses to live in isolation, tending a temple of Corellon just outside of Thornwood forest.
						</p>
						<p>
						Upon learning of the party’s quest to determine the cause of Alderwood’s destruction, and that Emeric was magically entrapped in a card, Shen broke his oath not to cast any more spells. He did so without explanation and the party became very distrustful of him (more so than they already were). Nonetheless, Emeric and the jewels were expelled from the card and for that the party was grateful. Before the party left the following morning, Shen warned that the area around Alderwood had been contorted by wild magic, reminiscent of the Spellplague, and that passage through the area would be very dangerous.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Sora Ironblood</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Sora is a dragonborn of House Ironblood, the 2nd most powerful House in Hlondeth. Though many vassals have been inaugurated into the House over several generations, she carries its bloodline. Her goal is to uphold the virtues of peace, order, and justice. To this end, she has taken on duties with the city guard (and with the militia in times of war). Others in her clan often become guards, messengers, arbiters, and paladins. Her House crest is a white lion against a purple backdrop, and she bares it on both her shield and her cape. When on-duty, she dons splint mail and a split-visor close helmet, and she wields a dao with a Norman-kite shield in her off-hand. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Sora first met the party on the beach outside Hlondeth. They’d swam in the night before and barely made it to shore alive. It seemed she’d come across refugees and castaways before - probably due to the rocky waters and recent flooding/turmoil in the land. She took the party through the city and introduced them to Temp, of Temp Consulting. There, the party would be given temporary lodging and work, so that they might integrate into the city. Later, she defended the party’s innocence when they were briefly suspected concerning the death of Ajerban.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Temp</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						A dragonborn, but not of particular nobility, Temp is an unusual character. He’d been an adventurer at one point, but eventually retired to focus on his adventuring company: Temp Consulting. His business connected those in need with willing adventurers. Its simplicity enabled Temp to quickly establish franchises in every town he visited, and his indomitable will squeezed his competitors out of the markets. To top it off, the world’s recent misfortune had brought him considerable wealth, though he was a man of simple tastes.
						</p>
						<p>
						When the party first met him, they noted he smelled somewhat of pipe weed, even in the early hours of the morning. His eyes and mind were sharp in spite of it, and was cordial with the party. Small vestiges hung down from his chin and jaw like whiskers. He’d braided some, and decorated them with beads. Very little seemed to perturb Temp, though his office was frequently in chaos. The party spent one month living in the loft above Temp Consulting’s main branch.
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Toranaga</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
						Few scoundrels have been so successful for so long. Toranaga has eluded the forces of good for over fifty years. He’s a sinister monster, who hires others to do his dirty work whenever possible, but he has no qualms taunting his victims. He would present himself as a ferryman, heading to Westgate. Groups of travelers would pay him, only to discover halfway that he was in truth a slaver. His crew would turn on the passengers and shackle them to the hull. He’d then sell them as slaves to the duergar in the southern jungles of Erlkazar and Tashalar. Any valuables the passengers were carrying would be sold or distributed among his crew.
						</p>
						<p>
						When the party first met Toranaga, he looked tall and surely, with enough chest hair for a dozen men. He had shaggy, black hair, tied back in a ponytail, and a long, drooping mustache that hung down past his chin (Fu Manchu). He wore a beautiful cloak with a red, white, and blue checker facing outward, and suns, stars, and moons over a midnight blue facing inward.
						</p>
						<p>
						One particular group of travelers, who now form part of the party, were able to escape when Toranaga’s ship crashed into a shoal in the waters near Hlondeth. When the party last saw Toranaga, he was headed into his personal quarters in The Duchess. After the ship struck the shoal, he could be heard pounding at a door, which was barricaded by barrels of apples, as the ship sunk. Then all was silent.
						</p>
						<p>
						Just over a month later, Toranaga reappeared in Hlondeth. He placed a bounty on the heads of the party members who’d escaped from his ship, at which point Rooze hastened out of the city.
