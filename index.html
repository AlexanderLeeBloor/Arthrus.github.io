					<dt>Episode 4: Hunters and Hunted</dt>
					<dd>
						<p class="tldr">TL;DR Elohim the Deliverer, whose true name was Shen, released Emeric from the card, along with all the jewelry that had been trapped inside with him. Rooze returned. He tracked the party to the elven temple and warned them that Toranaga had arrived in Hlondeth and placed a bounty on their heads. A dragonborn named Surina also arrived at the temple a short while later. He had been attacked by a tiefling hunting party, but escaped. It seemed safest for the party to travel in a large group, and they traveled south in a boat to Ankhapur. Along the way, another alien fish-monster swam beneath the boat. Also, a plucky, vagabond halfling took an interest in Elara and attempted (unsuccessfully) to convince her to give up her ways and adopt his lifestyle and philosophies. The party stopped to go hunting before reaching Ankhapur, and found a pair of large reptiles. They were able to retrieve one, but the other was eaten by an enormous creature called a bulette.</p>

					<dt>Episode 3: Goblinrock</dt>
					<dd>
						<p class="tldr">TL;DR The party cleared out the goblinrock and leveled up (you're all level 2!). Then they journeyed southwest, bought a boat, and went further southwest to an elven temple of Corellon where they met an abbot who called himself Elohim the Deliverer aka the Lonesome Cleric of Thornwood. He was blind so he doesn't know that Emeric is there. The party is about to tell him Emeric is there and blow his mind by telling him about the freaky card prison.</p>
						<p>The smell of scorched bark and burnt leaves stung everyone’s nostrils. Peering down the chute into the goblinrock, no one could make out any sign of life. No voices were heard, and the torches were all snuffed out. Even still, no one had any interest in repeating the sliding-stairs-to-hungry-rats fiasco. At the bottom of the chute, a hallway led forward out of sight. If they survived the choking flames, the goblins could be lying in wait with arrows nocked.</p>
						<p>To mitigate the risk of such an ambush, the adventuring company opted to lower Emeric (safe in his extradimensional card prison) on a rope. They fashioned a makeshift vice from materials on hand and lowered his card to the base of the chimney. At the bottom, he could see a short hallway that opened into some sort of alter chamber. At the far end of the chamber, on the west end, was an eight-foot statue of a goblin with fierce, fiery eyes and a coal-black battleaxe that dripped blood into a basin below. On the north side of the room was a double-door. As from outside, no goblins could be seen or heard. Emeric relayed the information and the rest of the company descended into the dungeon.</p>
						<p>Once inside, Elara noted that the structure was assuredly of goblin make. The floor, walls, ceiling, and statue bore the peculiarities typical of their stonework: well-cut, but somewhat rough with sharp edges at the corners. She considered claiming the axe, as it appeared to be magical, but it had an aura of evil about it and perhaps was cursed. Blood dripped endlessly from its tip, though the basin seemed never to run over.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, Ulrig examined a large gong that lay flat on the ground at the base of the chimney, now buried by charred branches. Its placement was clearly intentional and was seemingly intended to alert the dungeon to intruders. More out of curiosity than any other reason, the party agreed to ring the gong. BUOOONNGGG…. Nothing happened, though Selka, who was keeping watch outside, peeked in to check that all was okay.</p>
						<p>Large characters were scrawled in a goblin script near the double-door. They were illegible to the adventurers, so all that they could glean from the text was that it had been written in blood which had long since dried.</p>
						<p>Continuing on, the party opened the doors and followed another short corridor around a corner and further west into a smaller chamber. This room was a small ossuary, with a mound of goblin bones as its centerpiece. The walls were decorated with the skeletons of other creatures. Some were mounted like trophies. Others were piled in heaps. At the back of the ossuary was a large, rotary disk mounted against the wall. Its face was carved with the phases of the moon. Where the moon was new, a perfectly circular hole had been cut. Where the moon was full, only a faint outline was engraved. The remaining crescents, quarters, and gibbous moons were all carved to their appropriate curves, as one would expect. The party surmised that there may be a correlation between the position of the disk and the phase of the moon (on that note… Toril has two moons). However, they were unable to find any celestial correlation between the moons in the heavens and the moons on the disk.</p>
						<p>There was still no sign of the goblins the adventurers heard earlier, so the party investigated the room for secret passages. Ulrig found some scoring at disk’s fringes and suspected that the goblins knew some trick to turn it as a wheel. It was awfully heavy, and even he had difficulty spinning it with help from Elara and Cecil. With a great effort, it was spun halfway around, revealing a small passage that turned south. It was a tight fit – just tall enough for Elara to stand upright. She volunteered to lead the expedition deeper into the dungeon. Cecil followed in behind, but Ulrig waited in the ossuary as she checked round the corner.</p>
						<p>As Elara turned south, she saw the passage continued ten feet and then opened into a small treasure room. The three remaining goblins had holed up inside, breathing slowly what limited oxygen they must have had. The air was stale and reeked of their stench. The goblins drew their scimitars and confronted Elara at the mouth of the tunnel. She answered their swords with her greataxe, but in the tight space it was nearly impossible for her to make a proper swing. Similarly, the goblins had difficulty hitting her with their scimitars. They jabbed at her in desperation.</p>
						<p>Cecil and Ulrig found themselves in a difficult position. Cecil found himself unable to join the melee, and Ulrig had absolutely no hope of contributing to the combat. He hurled skulls through the tunnel, but they smashed uselessly against the bend in the passage. Two of the goblins stepped back into the treasure room and began firing arrows at Elara. Things were getting worse and it began to look like the goblins might be victorious! She suffered a nasty injury as her immediate quarry managed to scrape her with its sword. Steel continued to clash against steel as the battle continued. Ulrig crept into the tunnel and shoved Elera onto the goblin, hoping to he would bear the weight of her axe. It was unsuccessful in that regard, but with that push, Elara breached the threshold and fell into the room. The front line was broken!</p>
						<p>At this point, the battle escalated. Cecil chanted a dark incantation and instilled such fear into of the goblins that he died of fright! He fell to the ground. Soon after, Cecil entered the treasure room and enchanted the space with a sleep spell, putting everyone but Ulrig to sleep. As all fell silent, Ulrig crept into the room he roused his companions and dragged an injured goblin back to the ossuary. The goblin, unarmed and bloodied, could hardly resist the goliath. Ulrig held the struggling creature while the others executed the remaining goblin in his sleep. They plundered the treasure room, acquiring two sets of chainmail, a shield, a battleaxe, a steel mirror, a net, 1000sp, and the deed an estate in Hlondeth (someone by the name of Florestine).</p>
						<p>As Elara and Cecil returned with their plunder, they found Ulrig gently patting the goblin’s head. He seemed to know a few words, and among them “surrender” and “mercy.” Knowing his nature, the party suspected he would probably return to his ways if let go. Even still, it would be dishonourable to kill the helpless creature shortly after taking it prisoner. It could not remain a prisoner either – the party did not have the means to guard and escort it through the wilderness. Elara turned to her deity, Clangeddin Silverbeard (the dwarven deity of war, exarch of Moradin), for answers.</p>
						<p>As she completed her prayer, Elara felt a deep conviction grow within her. She realized with utmost certainty that this creature must answer for his crimes here and now, in the ossuary built by his kin and decorated with the bones of the innocent. Still, it would be dishonourable to kill the goblin outright after allowing it a chance to surrender. Elara retrieved the goblin’s sword and with a series of gestures communicated that it was to duel her. If it killed her in battle, it would be free to leave. Meanwhile, Ulrig and Cecil bore witness. The duel lasted only a few short seconds. After the two exchanged blows, Elara gained the upper hand and struck down the goblin. Evil though he was, he died with dignity.</p>
						<p>Their quest was complete, and so the group left the dungeon. They smashed its clay exterior and shoved in heaps of wood and dirt from the tree they’d uprooted, preventing any but the most determined monsters from returning and reclaiming the den as their own. Everyone rested, and felt much better afterward. Their experience in the goblinrock steeled their spines and thickened their skins. With heads held high, they continued their march southwest through the jungle. It would be two hundred miles to their next outpost: an elven temple on the fringe of Thornwood.</p>
						<p>Trekking through the steamy Chondathan jungle proved easier than expected. The sweaty nights and insect bites were uncomfortable, of course, but the party never found themselves in danger. Within two days, they arrived at the Wintercloak River. Providence must have befallen them, for there was a gathering of Chondathans arriving by boat as they reached the water’s edge. As it turned out, the group was headed to Hlondeth for Shieldmeet (a festival held all over Faerun on the summer solstice every fourth year, also known as “the Day of Corellon’s Peace” in elvish).</p>
						<p>The Chondathans were very friendly and more than willing to sell their boat for a fair price. It was a large canoe. Big enough for ten people and their supplies. After bartering briefly with the head of their company, the party exchanged several hundred silver and a shield for the canoe. All in all, it seemed a fair trade. The boat was very well constructed and had seen minimal use. The two groups went their separate ways and the party set a course upstream.</p>
						<p>Several days up the river, a massive fish (or maybe a whale or a shark?) passed beneath the boat heading downstream. Its sleek, grey body was at the very least forty feet long and five feet wide. It had long, tentacle-like appendages that ended in fins so slim they could be mistaken for arrow heads. Three alien eyes were stacked vertically above an enormous, circular maw baring hundreds of jagged teeth. Its teeth were layered in rows, extending deep into its throat beyond sight. Despite its harrowing appearance, it swam leisurely past the canoe and continued downstream. Its movement through the water made no discernable noise. In a way, the silence seemed ill-fitting for such a monster.</p>
						<p>Soon the party reached a beach on the south edge of the river, several miles east of the Cloven Mountains. They beached the canoe, lifted it above their heads, and carried it south for nearly six hours to an entirely separate river called the Thornwash. This river had numerous branches that connected many elven communities. Most such groups lived in small numbers, or entirely independently. The notable exception being Alderwood, which was a mid-sized city nestled in the wooded foothills of the Cloven Mountains before it was destroyed.</p>
						<p>After a few days journeying south down the Thornwash, the party arrived at their rest-stop: the elven temple. Unsurprisingly, the structure bore the silver sickle of Corellon. Across its tall stone pillars, elaborate designs had been sculpted on every inch of the structure. Illustrations told of great wars with orcs and with drow. Poetry and songs were engraved along walls in elvish. Lengthy histories of Corellon and elven civilization were chiseled with perfection. The temple was quite large, but its walls held only a massive, well-kept courtyard brimming with flowers, bushes, trees, and a humble vegetable garden.</p>
						<p>In the courtyard stood a single elf. He’d been chanting a prayer to Corellon and seemingly hadn’t noticed the party upon their arrival. He wore heavy robes, covering him entirely from the neck down – they looked absolutely sweltering in the southern summer heat. Even still, there wasn’t a drop of sweat on his brow. A cloth was wrapped about his eyes like a blindfold, and it too bore the silver sickle of Corellon. The elf carried the solemn grace of an abbot, and he presumably was one (even if only by default, for there were no other elves around). If his ascetic nature was not apparent enough already, his head was shaven and tattooed all over, similar to the images engraved all over the monastery walls.</p>
						<p>After finishing his prayer, the party hailed him. He responded by welcoming them to the temple and asking several questions about their purpose. The group wasn’t prepared to divulge the entirety of their intentions to a stranger whom they’d just met, and so answered with incomplete truths. The elf seemed content and introduced himself as Elohim the Deliverer, also known as the Lonesome Cleric of Thornwood. He allowed the party to rest within the temple’s walls and provided bedding so that they would be comfortable in the evening. His only conditions were that the party respect the temple and forage for their own food. He took the party hunting in the afternoon and showed them how to snipe monkeys with blow darts for an easy meal.</p>
						<p>As it turned out, Elohim was indeed blind and relied on his other senses entirely. Over dinner, he continued asking the party questions. He wanted to learn the personal histories of each traveler, as well as any songs or poems they might know. As he was blind, he could not see Emeric. If he was aware of Emeric’s presence, he said nothing indicative of it. Eventually, it began to feel impolite not to mention their companion’s predicament. He was, after all, a guest in the House of Corellon…</p>

					<dt>Episode 2: The Magician's Proposal</dt>
					<dd>
						<p class="tldr">TL;DR The party ran into a mysterious magician with a van dyck beard who took the deck of cards, minus Emeric, and told the party to go figure out what destroyed the city of Alderwood and a lot of the forest around it. If they did that for him, he would free Emeric from the card. The party picked up two recruits: Cecil and Selka, and decided to slay some goblins along the way.</p>
						<p>Following the party’s initial adventure in Hlondeth, the group spent some time familiarizing themselves with the city. Nothing of note occurred for three tendays (aside from those details summarized at the end of Episode 1). Ulrig, Elara, and Sharptooth continued living in their loft above Temp Consulting, but Rooze found himself mixing well into Rurik’s questionable company. He soon left and was put up at a tavern run by the Dead Men. As for Emeric, he remained entrapped in his pocket dimension.</p>
						<p>No sooner had the party got comfortable with their lot than tidings pulled them back to adventure. One morning, they awoke to the sound of an argument. Downstairs, Rurik’s familiar voice could be heard stammering and apologizing profusely. It seemed the original owner of a certain deck of cards had discovered its whereabouts and found his way to the adventuring firm. From the dialogue, the party became acutely aware that they’d been hired to retrieve stolen goods from Ajerban. The deck’s true owner would certainly be a force to be reckoned with, if Rurik’s fears were well-placed. He begged the man not to turn him into anything unnatural and willingly returned twenty-one cards from the deck. When pressed about the missing card, Rurik informed the man that it was in the possession of the occupants upstairs.</p>
						<p>Moments later, the man ascended the stairs and confronted the party. He was tall and slim, with several wrinkles on his brow and about his eyes. His hair was chestnut brown, medium length, and well groomed, and he sported a sharp beard (van dyke, specifically). He wore a tattered old traveler’s cloak, also brown, bearing an assortment of oddly shaped patches. Each had its own rune, written in some language (or languages) unknown to anyone else in the room.</p>
						<p>The man’s voice took on a gentle tone, albeit still firm. He politely requested that they return him his card, and was only slightly annoyed that Emeric had been trapped within. It seemed little more than an inconvenience to him. In fact, the longer he looked in at Emeric, the deeper he seemed lost in his own memories. He spoke of a time in his youth which resembled the party’s circumstance. Recalling how he learned and grew from his own experience, he offered the party a quest. If they could complete it, he would free their companion from his tiny prison.</p>
						<p>The group gathered round their map, and the mysterious man outlined his expectations. Pointing to Alderwood, an old elven stronghold in the southeastern forest of Thornwood, the man outlined its region in red ink. “Word has come to me that the entire area has been destroyed by a catastrophic force of unknown origin,” he explained. “I want to know what caused such destruction. Seek answers, and return to me when you uncover the truth behind the matter. You may carry your friend along on this journey if you like. To keep him company.”</p>
						<p>Just before he departed, the group asked the magician for his name, to which he replied that names can be very powerful secrets. He declined to reveal his identity, and suggested they refer to him as Ajerban, or Ajerban the 2nd.</p>
						<p>Downstairs, Rurik mentioned that his buyer would be very unhappy to learn that the deck was back in the hands of its original owner. He warned the party that trouble might come looking for them, so keep an eye open.</p>
						<p>The party felt uncertain about pursuing Ajerban’s quest immediately. They held several concerns about the dangers of the wilderness, but thought they might steel their wits with an adventure or two before the journey. Despite his allegedly successful business, many of Temp’s previous jobs were still available to novice swords-for-hire. The orc fortress at Mussum seemed a particularly daunting challenge, even with the promise of help from kobolds. The party decided their most promising adventure would be to assail the Goblinrock – a so-called hive of goblins causing trouble to the south across the Vilhon.</p>
						<p>Forgetting about Sharpooth (oops!), Ulrig and Elara scanned room for willing hands. The two of them would not be enough for this endeavor, but it was their luck that today two daring women found themselves looking for work. The first was a minstrel named Cecil, whose sour notes were met by comparably sour tomatoes (or, more likely, he refused to bend his notes to the tastes of unrefined ears). He was in need of money and a worthy tale to compose. The other sellsword was an older woman named Selka. She’d been a sailor in her youth, and in fact owned a firm comparable to Temp’s. If it weren’t for his inexplicable success, she wouldn’t have found herself in his office, driven out of business and in need of a job. Despite her age, she was hardy as any other and handy with a sword. She was a cleric of sorts and knew a bit of magic to boot.</p>
						<p>The party signed their contract with Temp and he gave them their pay up front, per the usual agreement. It was off to do away with the accursed Goblinrock! What foul stench lay within its walls, they could only imagine. The party bought and traded supplies as they felt they’d need and chartered a ship to take them across the channel. The captain was a rugged and capable man, although getting a bit old. He saw them through their one-day journey and had his son, Emmett, ferry the party the last stretch on a simple rowboat. Waters in these parts had rocky coasts, even near beaches. It would have been a great risk to take the ship any closer than a half-mile to the shore. Emmett was a capable young man, although not especially attractive. He’d lost some of his teeth in a fight, and his nose was slightly crooked. Nonetheless, he was a cheerful fellow for the thirty or so minutes they rowed. He found stories of adventure and mayhem exciting, and he was thrilled to facilitate what might one day be a great poem about slaying goblins.</p>
						<p>When they arrived on the south shore, the party took a lay of the land. The earth was a mix of sand and silt, with nearly no grass whatsoever. It was incredibly flat and barren, stretching almost a day’s march to the jungle canopy. Worse yet, it would be several hours along before outcroppings of rocks would provide some limited cover on the sandy wastes. The boat had gone, meaning there would be no guarantee of safe retreat. However, there were two silver linings which eased the party’s nerves as they progressed. One: it would be an easy march, and two: any approaching creatures – goblins or otherwise – could be spotted from a safe distance on the plain.</p>
						<p>Four hours into their march, the party spotted a goblin crew traversing the land to the west. They were somewhat closer than anyone had expected them to get before noticing. The heat and humidity, coupled with the goblins’ short stature and pale orange hue, may have allowed them to approach undetected for some time. Nevertheless, to attribute their approach to cunning and hunter’s skill would be to ignore their goblin nature. They seemed preoccupied with hunting sea birds, and had only noticed Ulrig momentarily before he noticed them. The two groups were nearly one thousand feet apart, but the goblins notched arrows in their bows and began a slow approach.</p>
						<p>With little time to think, the sellswords agreed to make for the nearest cover. They only had to keep out of range of the goblins’ shortbows, and they wagered that such small monsters would have difficulty outpacing them. Rather than exert themselves to exhaustion, the party matched pace with the goblins and marched onward toward the nearest rocks.</p>
						<p>It took nearly an hour to reach the rocks, but their cover was welcome. They stood over five feet tall and hid even Ulrig without issue. Lying in wait, the group devised their strategy. They would hold out with improvised projectiles, but when the goblins got close, they would charge into melee range where bows would be useless. It would be risky, but no less risky than their alternatives.</p>
						<p>As soon as the goblins came within range, they raised their bows to the sky and let out a volley in a tall arc. Arrows rained down and the party found their rocks less of a shield than they’d hoped. Ulrig’s shoulder was pierced deeply by an arrow, but he wrenched it free and hurled it back like a dart. It flew true, embedding itself in one of his enemies. Meanwhile, Elara hurled loose stones to weaken her enemies. She took the worst of their arrows, but her valour would not be shaken by the ordinary perils of a daytime skirmish. Selka drew upon her magic to create a small fog, obscuring the goblins and causing them to scatter. This was the party’s opportunity to get close. Drawing in close to its fringes, they prepared to charge and strike. The goblins emerged and were set upon with swords and axes. Their deaths were violent, but quick.</p>
						<p>The party retrieved the goblins’ bows, but found nothing else of use on the monsters. They dug a sandy pit to hide the bodies, and to return them to the world as respectfully as possible. Then, the party rested among the rocks.</p>
						<p>Continuing the next day, the party spotted a blurry goblinoid shape at the edge of the jungle. It was only present for a moment, but long enough to catch the eye. Cautiously, the party proceeded in that direction. As they came closer, the upper hemisphere of a skull became visible in the canopy. No goblins could be seen around it, but the shape itself was clearly unnatural. It was the shape of a human skull, but much too large. Perhaps it once belonged to a giant, but it was greyish-brown rather than white or yellowed. As the party crept up to it, they discovered it was made from clay, and the eye sockets had merely been painted over its smooth surface. Disappointing? Perhaps. Reassuring? Definitely. These were simple creatures. Not monsters of grand design and tasteful evil. But nonetheless, goblins were clever and capable architects. On the east side of the skull was an enormous tree and on the west was a thick bush. The “nose” had a wooden door that pulled outward by a string, although no one in the party wished to enter. It was suspected that such an obvious entrance would be trapped. Looking around, another entrance was discovered behind the bush. A small hole where an ear might have been led into a tall chute, soon to be dubbed “the chimney.” A ladder led down, and light could be seen bleeding out across the floor of a hallway below. Believing this to be the true entrance, but wishing to take no chances, the party watched the chimney as they felled a tree. Laying the bough across Goblinrock’s nose, the group opted to avoid a fight by suffocating any goblins inside. They prepared a large fire and dumped heaps of flaming lumber into the chimney, with many leaves and branches to create as much smoke as possible. The ladder itself was burned as well.</p>
						<p>The goblins inside began to scream in fear and cry out. There were several voices, although too few to do the word “hive” justice. It was a lair like any other. Some of the cries came out in common, shouting “Help!” and “Have mercy!” There was no mercy, however. Though it was not a dignified solution, it was the safest and easiest for the adventuring company. Eventually, the voices grew silent and the fire died away. The party waited an hour before lowering a rope, and they left it high enough that it could only be pulled down by a long hook or a bit of magic. With great difficulty, the party moved the tree from the nose and peered inside.</p>
						<p>There was no trap on the door, and a large stairway led down to a tunnel. Ulrig took a position as rear guard, while the others began descending the steps. Elara took the lead, but halfway down, her weight depressed a trick step. With a click, the whole stairway collapsed into a uniform slope. Ulrig hadn’t stepped onto it yet, but the others lost their balance and slid to the bottom, where the ground gave way beneath their feet. Cecil and Selka tumbled down behind Elara into a twenty-foot pit. It was a terrible fall. Worse yet, there was yet another trick in store: as the ground slipped away beneath Elara’s feet, it pivoted about a level, pulling on a string that lifted a wall. Behind this wall was, of course, a swarm of ravenous rats! Being rats, they were not immediately aware of their situation, but began scurrying toward the pit.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, Ulrig witnessed his friends tumble down into darkness and he heard to screeching of one hundred hungry mouths. Thinking quickly, he slid down the smooth stairs with the skill of a seasoned acrobat, vaulting the gap and hurling a pair of torches between himself and the rats. Uncertain if two flames would stay the beasts, he drew another pair of torches and piled the fire higher. He was then confident no rat would dare to cross his line.</p>
						<p>Afterward, the fallen companions stacked themselves upon one another to form a chain, reaching up to Ulrig’s extended hands. Working together, the party was able to pull the group out of the pit. With some effort, they were also able to reset the stairs and climb out of the nose. It was an altogether awful reminder what nasty architects goblins could be. Thankfully, if all went well there would be no other goblins living in the Goblinrock. And maybe some treasure for the party’s trouble?</p>

					<dt>Episode 1: Deadbeat Wizard</dt>
					<dd>
						<p class="tldr">TL;DR The party met a guard named Sora Ironblood who introduced them to the city and showed them where to find quests and temporary lodging. They took on a quest to retrieve a magical artifact from a wizard. The wizard was dead when they arrived, but they retrieved the artifact and it was a deck of cards. Emeric got sucked into one of the cards and is now trapped within, along with a large fortune. Now the guy who asked them to get the artifact from the wizard has to find a way to get Emeric out, so he's pissed. Flash forward one month and nothing has changed a whole lot.</p>
						<p>The party awoke the next morning when they were hailed by a member of the town guard. She stood over six feet tall, and wore splint mail with a split-visor close helmet. She’d drawn her sword, a dao, but it wasn’t raised. In her offhand, she held a large shield (the Norman-kite variety) embossed with an illustration of a lion. She also wore a cape with the same illustration. She listened to the group’s explanation, saw the shackles, and decided it was plausible.</p>
						<p>The guard guided the party into the city and escorted them to an establishment where they could find temporary lodging and work to earn some money. The establishment was a branch of an adventuring company called Temp Consulting and was located one mile inland. The city was absolutely massive. It bustled with activity. Merchants, sailors, farmers, scholars, and countless other trades intermingled in the wide streets. Beasts of burden pulled carts filled with commodities of all kinds from all parts of the world. The city’s inhabitants were equally diverse.</p>
						<p>Since the walk took some time, the guard introduced herself and provided the party with a detailed introduction to the city and its history. Her name is Sora Ironblood, of House Ironblood. To them, there is nothing greater than to uphold the virtues of peace, order, and justice. [The rest that she talked about is in the Lore section. It’s a lot of unnecessary information, so I left it out of the recap.]</p>
						<p>Finally, the party arrived at Temp Consulting. Sora introduced the group to Temp, an older dragonborn who’d retired from adventuring and started the firm. Small vestiges hung down from his chin and jaw like whiskers or vestiges. He’d braided some. Others, he accessorized with beads. Temp smelled somewhat of pipe weed, though his eyes and mind were sharp. He agreed to provide accommodation to the new arrivals, and he pried apart their shackles.</p>
						<p>In his lobby, a menagerie of clients were waiting to hire workers on contract. Temp had already spoken with his clients before the party arrived, so all that remained was for them to choose their task. He was uncomfortably clear about the fact that he and his clients considered the party expendable labour, but guaranteed that they would be well-compensated. In fact, they were paid upfront.</p>
						<p>Upon hearing their options, the party agreed that most quests sounded very dangerous. At least one of the jobs seemed outright evil. They could choose to help clear out a den of goblins; lead an attack against a savage orc encampment; clear the sewers of unwanted vermin; retrieve a willing sacrifice from his family (who had kidnapped him after learning his plan); or recover a magical artifact from a wizard named Ajerban, who was supposed to bring it to a merchant. Since it sounded the least likely to get them killed or arrested, they chose to get the artifact from the deadbeat wizard. The party paid Sharptooth some gold to join them on their quest, and Ulrig gave him his shark tooth trophy out of sympathy for the oppression of the kobold underclass in Hlondeth. Just before they set out, Elara traded her scimitar to Sora for some gold, so that she could afford a particularly expensive axe.</p>
						<p>The task was very straightforward. They would go to his home, knock on the door, and ask him why he hadn’t done as he’d agreed. If he was cooperative and had the artifact, he would bring it forward in a simple wooden box, to be taken back to the client. The client, a man named Rurik, gave the party directions to the wizard’s temporary residence. It was easy to find because it was actually a windmill with a small bedroom in the loft. The party knocked at the door. Knock knock knock. Nobody answered. They knocked harder. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Still nothing. Next, they tried calling out. Again, there was no answer, although passers-by began turning their heads to see the cause of the ruckus. Looking around the sides and back, there were no other entrances or windows, but a crack in the stone did allow Rooze to peer in. He spotted what looked like their wizard, curled up on the floor and unmoving.</p>
						<p>Once Rooze passed this information back to the party, Emeric set to work picking the lock. It took very little time and the party was soon inside the windmill. Dead wizard aside, nothing seemed out of place. There was machinery for grinding wheat and some bags of flour, but little else. Nothing suggested the wizard had been attacked or was involved in a struggle. Indeed, the party was unable to discern Ajerban’s cause of death. They were distrustful of magic, believing all was not as it seemed. Could this be an elaborate trick? Was he hoping the party would assume him dead and leave? Or could this be a trap? Everyone was on their guard. After searching the main floor and finding nothing, the party looked up at the second floor. They couldn’t see much of it, but the tip of a carpet was visible at the edge of the stairs. Rooze recalled Emeric’s ability to communicate simple ideas to small creatures and suggested he send a bird to investigate. Emeric concurred and whistled to draw one in. He sent it upstairs and had it land on the carpet. Like a bear-trap, the carpet sprung up! The bird was crushed and smothered inside its folds, and the body was flung onto the floor nearby.</p>
						<p>It was almost a relief to know that there was at least one trap present. It meant the space was protected by spells, which it should be if there’s an artifact hidden nearby. The group made their way to the top of the stairs, where they saw a simple bedchamber. It contained a carpet, a bed with a sword resting atop the sheets, and a dresser. On the dresser was the unmarked wooden box that they’d come to collect. However, Rooze still feared more traps, so he signaled to Sharptooth to retrieve the box. Sharptooth obliged, stepping carefully around the carpet. He returned the box and Rooze signaled for him to retrieve the sword as well. Once more he obliged, but when he touched it, the weapon sprang to life. It swung at him as he leapt away, cutting his back. It pursued the group as they scrambled down the stairs and only stopped after they hurried out the front door. Ulrig picked up Ajerban’s body as they fled, so that he could receive a proper burial. The body had a coffer on hand, which they left with it as payment for his coffin and rites. Besides, they’d attracted quite a bit of attention to themselves and didn’t want to be mistaken for robbers.</p>
						<p>Before the town guard arrived at the scene, Emeric took the box and opened it to identify its contents. Inside was an elaborately decorated deck of cards. He counted twenty-two in total. The illustrations depicted all manner of scenes. Many were pleasant, but equally many were frightful. He held a deep appreciation for the artistry. Oddly, as he held the deck, he felt a presence in his mind. It asked, “how many cards do you wish to draw?”</p>
						<p>Startled, Emeric responded with a number before considering the possibility of a consequence. “Six,” he thought. Immediately, the deck shuffled itself and he drew six cards. What followed was an extraordinary sequence of events. First, all of Emeric’s material wealth and property vanished. It was unwritten from time itself, with only Emeric himself able to recall his original past (Temperance/Ruin). Then, he was raptured away from the material plane and entrapped within the second card (The Hermit/Donjon). Thirdly, he found his physical qualities enhanced. They were no longer bound by the conventional limitations of ordinary mortals (The Star/Star). However, his next card brought upon him the enmity of a fiend. In that moment, a creature beyond his knowledge or imagination gained a supernatural interest in him and pledged to hunt and doom him (The Devil/Flames). Before he could process these revelations, his fifth card rained jewelry upon him. It was an enormous pile of gold, silver, diamonds and pearls, all ornately assembly with brilliant artistry. At the very least, he would have something to inspect while living in his timeless card prison (The Wheel of Fortune/Gem). His final card had yet another nasty effect. The card warned that a friend of his would now be foe, and their condemnation would go beyond all reason and rationality (Judgement/Rogue).</p>
						<p>All sorts of gossip and pointing had filled the street. What sorcery was this? A man who stood before his friends could be pulled suddenly into a tiny card?! And who was the deceased? It was clear he’d been some sort of wizard, which created many more questions than it answered. Soon, guards arrived and demanded an explanation. The party was escorted to a jail, where they waited briefly to be exonerated by Sora. Afterward, they left Ajerban’s body with the guards and returned to Rurik.</p>
						<p>Rurik was enraged. The gratitude of having his item retrieved kept him from losing his temper entirely, but he berated the party extensively for using a dangerous magical item whose qualities were entirely a mystery to them. And how could he sell a magical deck of cards with one card no longer in its original form? Rooze offered to help find a way to retrieve Emeric from the card, for some form of payment. That really set Rurik off, and in his anger he threatened to kill Rooze, making vague threats about some group called the Dead Men. Once he calmed down, Rurik said he would look into finding someone who could help get Emeric out of the card. He let the party hold onto Emeric, but he took the rest of the deck for safekeeping.</p>
						<p>[One month later]</p>
						<p>The party spent the next month earning their keep and getting acquainted with Hlondeth. During this time, your characters may have chosen to look into a variety of things (you can specify), but here’s a few notable occurrences:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Rurik went on to befriend Rooze and introduced him to a small network of low-level criminals around the city. Rurik is a fence for the group that calls themselves the Dead Men, which are divided into two factions: legitimate mercenary work and organized crime. The two factions don’t overlap much, but know one another and don’t interfere with each other.</li>
							<li>Sharptooth intermingled with the kobolds. One day, a band of kobolds presented a chain to Ulrig. It was forged from the old irons that once restrained him aboard Toranaga’s ship. The chain weighs about 4lbs and holds a glass pendant. It has the appearance of a dragon’s eye, and seems to signify their gratitude to him. From his card, Emeric appraised its worth to be 25gp.</li>
							<li>Elara met several dwarves who were sympathetic to her plight. They found her some temporary work as a smith, where she became acquainted with the servants of a variety of clients. Most were armsmasters for military and mercenary groups, but one or two wealthy merchants and lords made special orders.</li>

					<dt>Prologue: Deliverance</dt>
					<dd>
						<p class="tldr">TL;DR The party began as slaves on a boat, but escaped and swam to a big stone city that glows faintly green.</p>
						<p>Five unlikely strangers stood shackled to a ship’s hull. Each had paid the cheapest available ferry, The Duchess, a small sum to be taken to Westgate. Midway, however, as the ferry sailed calmly across the Inner Sea, its captain and crew attacked their patrons! Their possessions were taken, and the ship’s course shifted southward, down through Vilhon Reach.</p>
						<p>Toranaga, the beguiling captain and rakshasa slaver, smiled as he announced the fate of his captives: to be sold to the gray dwarves that live beneath the mountainous jungles of Tashalar. One of the strangers, a goliath named Ulrig, took particular offense and responded that he was no slave to anyone. Toranaga didn’t seem overly bothered by the remark. Nonetheless, he slapped Ulrig to demonstrate control. Then he retired to his quarters to rest.</p>
						<p>The prisoners found themselves unsupervised. A stranger by the name of Sharptooth began an elaborate attempt to escape. He was a kobold – a small, reptilian creature with a keen intellect – and was fluent only in the draconic tongue. Unable to communicate his intentions to the others, he set about his plan. First, he bit into the hull as hard as he could, breaking off one of his fangs. Then, he retrieved the fang between his teeth and used it to pick his shackles, which came open after a great deal of fiddling. Sharptooth escaped the room through a doorway that led in the direction of Toranaga’s quarters.</p>
						<p>Over the next few hours, a stranger named of Emeric was able to use his knowledge of shackle design to slip out of his wrist-irons. He was, after all, a gnomish Lophi locksmith. The foot-irons proved inescapable without a key, so Emeric pried them from the wall. The others made their own attempts to free themselves, but were less successful. Emeric helped pry their irons from the hull and the group started to work out a plan.</p>
						<p>One of the strangers was a dark elf by the name of Rooze. His drow ancestry allowed him to see far into the blackness as he peered through The Duchess’ portholes. It was a clear, quiet night. To port, the sea stretched out beyond the horizon. To starboard, a city could be seen in the distance. Its enormous stone walls glowed faintly green, creating reflections in the water that resembled an aurora.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, Elara Silveraxe, a stranger and paladin of Clangeddin Silverbeard (the dwarven god of war), took to barricading the passage toward Toranaga’s quarters. Looking around the room, she found that the barrels, stocked with fresh apples, would best suit her purposes. She worked with Ulrig to stack them at the door, but not before the group pocketed a few apples.</p>
						<p>Rooze turned his attention to the crew’s activities above deck. They shouted to one another about an inability to turn the ship. Nobody seemed to know what was wrong and soon enough they were calling for everyone to grab onto anything tied down. A blast came from the stern, and the ship jarred to the side. “The reef! We’ve struck the reef!” the slavers shouted.</p>
						<p>The groaning and snapping of wood on the coral was deafening, but even still the strangers could make out the unmistakable sound of rushing water. It began seeping in beneath the barricade. The slavers made no attempt to retrieve their cargo, choosing to flee with their lifeboats and material wealth instead. Elara was furious. They’d taken her sacred symbol of divinity: a crossed pair of silver battleaxes. Through the portholes, she could see them paddling to the southeast, directly away from the city.</p>
						<p>Back at the stern, Toranaga could be heard pounding at the door, but soon he went silent. Perhaps he had realized was that his path was barred by several hundred pounds of apples, that his crew was incompetent, and that the slaves had escaped. Perhaps he escaped by some other means. Or perhaps he drowned.</p>
						<p>In any case, after Toranaga’s disappearance, a familiar voice could be heard squealing from behind the door. It was Sharptooth! The strangers moved their barrels. The ones on the bottom were fully submerged at this point, and Emeric found himself treading water. As the last barrel was hauled aside, the door swung open and a surge of water swept everyone off their feet. The group had half-expected Toranaga to emerge, but he was nowhere to be found. Sharptooth frantically swam to the stairs leading to the top deck, and the others followed suit.</p>
						<p>Up top, they found no remaining lifeboats, but wagered they could make the swim to shore. To be safe, Emeric grabbed an empty barrel. Looking around the deck for anything useful, the strangers discovered an abandoned scimitar and a dagger. Elara took the scimitar (not an axe, but better than nothing), and Rooze the dagger. Ulrig and Emeric were capable fighters in their own respects, so had no need for the weapons. One of the strangers pocketed a few gold pieces from a coffer stashed near the rigging. Once the deck had been searched, the group contemplated leaping into the water. Presumably, there were shallow reefs in the area, so the idea was cast aside after brief consideration. Instead, they waited until the warm waters rose up around them and soon the ship had receded into the depths below. It was time for a swim!</p>
						<p>The city was about three miles to the northwest. Thank heavens for calm waters – anything else would have been a death sentence. The party exerted as little energy as possible while swimming toward the mainland, but their efforts were thwarted by an untimely shark! About one mile into their swim, the shark took notice. It wouldn’t normally attack people, but it was approaching the group and everyone felt very much in danger. Being a gnome, Emeric was very close to nature and called a collection of small beasts to his aid. With a sequence of gestures, resembling an underwater dance, he drew in a small swarm of quipper fish to distract the reef shark. Sure enough, the school of quippers caught its eye and it chased after them. However, in an effort to draw in more fish, Emeric accidentally called back the original school, as well as the shark. At that point, the group decided to fight it head-on. They surrounded it, kicking and punching and slashing at it. Elara grabbed on to the beast, believing she might be able to calm it and perhaps even tame it. She knew very little of the sea, so this seemed a plausible outcome. No one else placed any faith in the wild shark, and after bludgeoning the beast unconscious, they left it for dead. Ulrig took one of its teeth as a trophy, and as the group continued their swim to shore, the quippers closed in to devour the shark.</p>
						<p>All in all, the swim took four hours. It was utterly exhausting, and the party spent what remained of the evening laying on the beach outside the city walls. With the danger behind them, it seemed appropriate that introductions be made. Rooze, Elara, Ulrig, and Emeric described their pasts to varying extents and were strangers no longer (with the exception of Sharptooth, who did not speak the language). They fell asleep there on the beach, blanketed by the pale green light that radiated from the city walls.</p>
